    This will always try to use logical structure (via PLAYA-PDF) to
    identify tables.

    For the moment, this only works on tagged and accessible PDFs.
    Like `paves.image`, it will eventually be able to use a variety of
    other methods to do so, most of which involve nasty horrible
    dependencyses (we hates them, they stole the precious) like
    `cudnn-10-gigabytes-of-c++`.  But it will never require you to
    install these so in the worst case... you won't get any tables.

    Note: These tables cannot span multiple pages.
        Often, a table will span multiple pages.  With PDF logical
        structure, this can be represented (and sometimes is), but if
        there is no logical structure, this is not possible, since
        tables are detected from the rendered image of a page.
        Reconstructing this information is both extremely important
        and also very difficult with current models (perhaps very big
        VLMs can do it?).  Since we also want to visualize tables with
        `paves.image`, we don't return multi-page tables here.

    Args:
        pdf: PLAYA-PDF document, page, pages, or path to a PDF.

    Yields:
        `TableObject` objects, which can be visualized with
        `paves.image` functions.  Yes, we can do table structure
        prediction on these, too, but that's a different function.
